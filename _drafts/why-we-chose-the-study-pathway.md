There are so many ways to get your immigration journey started. We will try to talk about the rest in the coming days but, for now, we will focus on the path that we took. 

The International Student Pathway!

Let's get the CONS out of the way.

## Expensive


## Longer Route

Longer (before you become PR)

## Limited Working Hours 

This may be outdated though since there's a push from the government to allow students to work more hours, because they need more workers!



Now, let's get to the good stuff!

## Easier

AGE!

## Chance to Reinvent

-   You can re-choose your career path, and the Canadian education you get puts you on the path
    -   Internship
    -   THought: split this into two points

## Network

-   Build your network / mentorship
    -   You can use your experience too!
