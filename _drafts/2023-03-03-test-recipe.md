<p>It was my first time to make homemade burger... and my first time to cook something here besides frying egg and spam! ðŸ˜… </p>
<p>Although, I had to tweak the recipe because I was missing some ingredients, it still turned out well. I think! The twist gave it that distinct Pinoy taste!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
- Ground beef: I used the pure lean beef that we got. For juicier results, the 80/20 lean-to-fat ratio works best
- Crushed crackers: the perfect binders 
    - You can also use Panko bread crumbs
- Knorr Liquid Seasoning:  for that distinct Pinoy taste
    - If you want a deeper beefy, smoky flavor replace this with Worcestershire sauce
- Egg: binds your ingredients without drying
- Milk: to soften and tenderize the ground beef
- Seasonings:  
    - Salt
    - Pepper
    - Garlic Powder
    - Onion powder
    - other spices of choice (optional)

<em>Unfortunately, I can't give you the proper amounts since I used the <u>tsamba-tsamba</u>, i.e. the guessing game, method!</em>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
1. Dump the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Knorr Liquid seasoning, milk, and spices into a large mixing bowl
    1. Use your hands (preferrably unwashed for extra flavour ðŸ˜…) and thoroughly mix ingredients until smooth
1. Divide the mixture into even balls of hamburger patty mixture
1. Using a baking sheet, place the patty mix and press them firmly into patties of your desired thickness
    1. Remember: These will shrink a bit once cooked, so you want them slightly larger than your buns/bread
    1. For thick patties, you want to press a dent in the center so they donâ€™t puff up while cooking
1. Preheat your grill, pan or skillet to medium heat
1. Start fryin' or grillin'
    1. For best result, only flip your burgers once or twice
