I actually have a question related to canada

You sent
Sure. What’s that?

[MD]
Im applying for a 1 year diploma course. do i get to have a work permit afterwards? and if so, like how long is the validity of that permit?
i plan to study either International Business Management or Supply Chain Management in Niagara College (HOPEFULLY!!!)

You replied to [MD]
You usually get a work permit together with your study permit, so you can work part time while studying (though there’s talk that they will remove the 20 hrs/week restriction soon)
After your study permit, you can then apply for a post graduate work permit (pgwp)!
However, it’s recommend that you study for at least 2 years because
A 1yr course will get you a 1yr PGWP, which may not be enough time for the next step, which is a PR
You sent
If you study for 2 years, you can apply for a 2yr PGWP

[MD]
but with a PGWP, I can work and then apply for PR right?

You sent
This was 2021 rules though so you might want to check it there’s been updates since

You replied to [MD]
Yes.
Coooool.

[MD]
they are actually a 1 year Graduate certificate
but likely for next year October. i think. hahaha
at least the tuition is more affordable, at 9k CAD a sem for intl students. which is within my budget.

You sent
Cool. October. You’re gonna get there real quick.
Yeah. Best to research about that PGWP but that was the recommendation from the agency we worked with

[MD]
well september pala, for the fall semester. it's really near the falls. lol kaya niagara college
i have an agent too. but he's been talking more about working. and me getting a job permit

You sent
Yup. Heard of it. It’s good din na malayo from downtown. Cheaper apartments, hopefully
You replied to [MD]
That’s even better. Less expenses.

[MD]
planning to do on campus i think.
on campus living and meals and stuff.
cheap and i saw the rooms, not tooo.... bad.

You sent
Hahaha. Cool. Good luck lang with the rommates. I assume you would have some
Alaine was not eligible since I’m with her. Haha

[MD]
hehe. well i dont know anyone in niagara.

[MD]
please dont tell ate yet hehe
lets keep it between us pls
i am not ready to tell her, because I know she will spread it to the whole world haha

[MD]
Hi kuya ryan, I told her na 🙂
Can I have some help with the filing process? Like the GIC and tuition and all that?

You replied to [MD]
Haha. I kept things between us lang naman.
Unfortunately, we got help through the agency for the student permit so they helped Alaine with all those application forms.

[MD]
Aaah okay
Man I spent so much on an agency for work and now I’m taking the study path haha
May I ask… where do you live? Student housing or with someone you know?
and how long before school started did you get to Toronto?

You replied to [MD]
We actually didnt pay the agency anything for the student pathway. We think they got commission from the school
We started by living with someone I knew but now renting on our own. We got a 1BR basement in Scarborough
Our visa approval took awhile so we got here a week and a half before school started which is not advisable. Most got here about a month before daw

[MD] replied to you
yeah i think a month before is the recommended also, to acclimatize and everything. i was thinking of coming 2 weeks before, if i can . Ate will be with me, and possibly my dad
may i ask how much rent you are paying?
i was looking at lodging, and they look very expensive, like 1300CAD is the cheapest, and its a small room, but with amenities.

You sent
That’s exactly the price we’re paying.

[MD]
some have meal plans, some dont

You sent
We could get some cheaper but will have to share kitchen and bathrooms…
And I kinda want my privacy

[MD]
man, i dont cook, so its definitely more affordable for me to have a meal plan.

You replied to [MD]
I’m surprised the price is the same though given that Niagara should not be in GTA (Greater Toronto Area)

[MD]
im particular about privacy, and a bit of space, like i dont want cramped everything.
oh, im in the city!

You sent
I thought Niagara Falls college would be closer to the border. Hahaha. My bad.

[MD]
i got accepted in Niagara College Canada-Toronto School of Management
actually i applied there, and i didnt realize i also applied to the main campus
but the thing is, they don't have on campus
i applied to 2 campuses hahaha

You sent
Oh. Just found it on Google Maps

[MD]
thinking it was one only. the websites look similar

Niagara College Toronto · 22 College St, Toronto, ON M5G 1K2
Right in the middle of downtown

[MD]
its in the middle of the city yeah
totally middle.
and lodging nearby is like 1,500 for students, etc
so im trying to do a comparison table

You sent
Yup. That’s going to be more expensive talaga.

[MD]
like what are my options and stuff
and since actually new school year technically is fall, right, some of the good lodgings are available only on September
but i also feel a bit apprehensive about those lodgings na pang student bec well, im 39. hahaha
im not young
not young, wild, and free
LOOOL

You sent
Haha. That’s true. Alaine has young classmates.
For our basement, we found it using Facebook Marketplace
The farther you go from downtown, the cheaper but transportation will be a hassle
Alaine’s work (internship) is downtown and starts at 630am so she has to take Uber daily at 545am

[MD]
wow
okay what do you think of this place
https://pearsonhousing.com/1100-king-st-w/flex-room/
Flex Room | Pearson Housing
im trying to figure out whats wrong with it that it is about $1,100CAD a month

You sent
Looks nice. Shared bathroom though

[MD]
Pearson Housing... seems too good to be true, given the rates
AAAAAAHHHH
okay there you go
i missed that one. hahaha thanks for spotting that
my practically non negotiables, 1. be near the school, 2. have a gym included in rent, (that has to be additional 60-80CAD im sure), 3. meal plans preferably.
oh and private room of course
shared bathroom... up to 2 people only

You sent
Gym is good but there are gyms here (planet fitness, fit 4 less, etc) that are pretty affordable

[MD]
budget, i dont know. i dont know the ongoing rates eh. i initially thought i could go with 1000CAD, but seems like there is nothing that is of that amount

You replied to [MD]
Yeah. I think this is tolerable
Yup. Nothing that’s close to downtown

[MD]
i need the gym and really closeby. like i need it for my mental wellness. its a must
and i think my options go back to city center because i want to have time to focus on reading papers and stuff. it is a management course, so i want everything easily accessible.
i have my particulars. sigh

[MD]
can i ask also... how long did it take for your to 1. get an appointment set with the canadian embassy for student permit?, like what was your wait time aka how long did it take until you were able to see the canadian embassy, and 2. how long was the processing?
i have 5 months, im anticipating to get my acceptance in 3 weeks, like by November 18, as the coordinator said.
acceptance from the school. so I want to process it already and cancel my work permit simultaneously

You replied to [MD]
I’ll have to ask Alaine for the exact timeline but we did not really see the canadian embassy. There was no interview or anything. We (agency) submitted October after our medical, then had biometrics (finger prints) taken and that was it. We got our visa 2.5months later

You sent
Btw, they recommend that your passport’s expiration is way past your anticipated stay because they usually grant visa only until your passport expiration date

[MD]
That’s what I thought too. I was trying to outline it all. Just do biometrics apptmt and submit the passport
hey where did you get your GIC?

yup, mine is until 2029

You replied to [MD]
GIC? What’s that?
Is that the guarantee deposit for the tuition? Coz we did not have to deposit anything
We just showed our existing bank accounts for the show money

[MD] replied to you
Yeah it’s this
Oh okay
Man I want to stay somewhere where price is really low, very decent and I’m not a bother to them. but I’m not sure where. Any suggestions?

You sent
Since you need a gym, you need to find a condo unit since those are the ones that have ‘em. It gets cheaper as you move further from downtown. Our 1BR basement is 1.3k but when we searched for places downtown, similar units were all above 2k.

[MD]
Do you remember/know the Manahans? They are my godparents and live in etobicoke. Do you know where that is and how far it is to the city? I was thinking of maybe temporarily staying with them first and then moving to the city. But I wanted to also check like what’s a compromise I can get
And they actually never offered. But I was going to ask them Lang. Or have my dad ask them

You sent
The last name is familiar, but I can't put faces to it. Etobicoke is more than 2 hrs from our place in Scarborough (via commute) ... so probably 1hr from downtown too.

[MD]
Not too bad, if they are open to it, at least for 4 months. And I saw some gyms I can sign up with near school. What’s your budget monthly for food and transpo?
Sorry if I’m asking personal questions. I just want to be thorough

You sent
No worries at all.
It just takes me time to response coz I’m at work. Haha.
Hmm… Alaine cooked before so our grocery budget was pretty low at 400 monthly.
Since I work from home, I usually take the bus only on weekends.
Alaine takes the uber these days because her work starts super early so medyo mahal at $40 daily but when she was taking the bus, she got the discounted rate (for students) which was around 160 monthly unlimited rides for bus and trains

[MD]
How much is monthly rate for public transport cards? I know There’s something like that right

yey i got my formal letter of acceptance!

You replied to [MD]
Yup. For students, $160 unlimited but I know there’s a discount for students

You replied to [MD]
Awesome! Congratulations!

[MD]
hi Kuya, did you pay THIS MUCH for a medical exam???

You sent
Yup. Around that range. Ours was 10k

[MD]
Omg where did you do yours?

You sent
IOM Health.

[MD]
Thanks

You sent
According to Alaine, that’s on the list on IRCC

[MD]
That’s the one I’m going to

[MD]
Salcedo street right

You sent
Yup. They probably raised their rates na.
That’s a huge jump though

[MD]
Ay no I am communicating with nationwide
Man this migration this is expensive

You sent
Haha. Yes it is

[MD]
But I want to really just do it after I’ve paid my tuition fees
Are there limits to the kinds of jobs Alaine can work in while being a student? I’m hoping for a desk job na 20 hrs
Mainly asking if you know what are the limitations of PGWP

You replied to [MD]
Not really. Also, I think they’re removing the 20 hrs limit for students

[MD]
So allowing more hours?

You sent
Yup. More hours.

[MD]
I’m hoping to go corporate na straight
I did see something like making it 25 hrs

You sent
I don’t really know the latest update. I thought it was going to be removed completely but I’m probably wrong
Yup. No harm going for it.
I actually had an open mind about possibly doing retail or something… but lucky enough to get a job close to what I had in Pinas

[MD]
What do you do now? Atleast sana this allows you to get a WP if alaine’s PGWP expires and she can ride on your WP

You sent
I'm back in IT. QA Manager

[MD]
Thanks fantastic! Congratulations!

[MD]
hi Kuya, which route did you take, the IRCC-Student permit or the SDS stream?
the Student Direct Stream? I dont know how to go the student direct stream, but that is what the college recommended.

You sent
I actually do not know. The agency helped us with that eh.

[MD]
Oh no. I don’t want to pay for an agency anymore 🙁
I spent 300k and then withdrew the EE visa request to study

You sent
We did not pay for our agency eh. They got the commission from the school, I think.

[MD]
Oh I see. What’s the agency?

You sent
iCanada. I forgot their URL but it should be on the article I blogged about. I’ll send it later. Gotta rush to a meeting
