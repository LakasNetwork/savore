In this episode of The Immigrant Chronicles 🎙️, I catch up with my buddy and fellow basketball junkie, AJ Salvacion. 🏀 

🇵🇭 We dive into his journey as an immigrant, covering the highs and lows of the past year. AJ also spills the beans on snagging a job abroad straight out the gate and gives some great advice on networking in a new place. 🇦🇺
