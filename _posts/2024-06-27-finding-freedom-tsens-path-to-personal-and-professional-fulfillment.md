Hey folks, on today's episode, I'm joined by Tsen, all the way from Newfoundland, Canada. Tsen shares his journey from the Philippines to Canada, starting with his leap to Singapore in 2016 and then navigating the complexities of moving to Canada in 2018. He talks about his challenges, from adjusting to new cultures to dealing with immigration processes and language barriers. 🌍✈️

In Canada, Tsen found stability and acceptance, which allowed him to flourish both professionally and personally. He reflects on how Canada's inclusive environment contrasted with the judgmental atmosphere he experienced in the Philippines, particularly in terms of his identity and freedom to live authentically. His journey through various immigration programs, supported by agencies, underscores the opportunities available to skilled workers seeking a better life abroad. 🌍✈️🇵🇭🇨🇦

Join us as Tsen shares insights into his transformation and the lessons he's learned along the way. 🌍✈️🇨🇦
