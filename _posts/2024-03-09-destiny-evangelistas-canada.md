In this episode of The Immigrant Chronicles 🎙️, the Evangelistas join me for a fun conversation about their journey. 🇨🇦 

We talked about how destiny started their pathway to Canada, and all the challenges and joys that came with that move. 🛫 They also talked about paying it forward through the volunteer programs available for newcomers. Of course, I also asked them to share some words of advice for those planning to take the leap.
