> If you don't mind po, any advice po how to start with the migration process? Given I'm already 30. Hehe. 

Man, if only we had this conversation face-to-face, I'd have smacked this kid on the head. ðŸ˜‚ He sure knows how to make me feel ancient. 

I was a very valid question though since that was actually one of the reasons [we took the student pathway](/blog/5). Also, not unlike us, he also shared his list of preferred countries. 

I thought I'd share some generic advise here since I've been asked this question multiple times already. Again, this is GENERIC. I do not know your personal situation, so please take this with a grain of salt. Also, most of this is based on our Canadian journey, and there will definitely some peculiarities depending on which country you decide to go for. 

### Commitment

I told you this was generic! Seriously though, you have to be committed to it. It is a long, often tough, process so you have to be committed to it and approach it with a lot of patience and persistence. 

The approval process (from the Embassy) can take between 2-4 months, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. You'll have to collate necessary documents, write letters and take medical exams. Just the first one alone could take a full year. 

### Save! Save! Save!

Whatever pathway you decide on, you'll probably need money. The only exception would be getting a job offer overseas. Still, it doesn't hurt to have some savings lying around. 

Speaking of job offers...

### Search for relocation job sites

This will depend on your experience and qualifications. I can only speak for tech-specific opportunities, since that's what I spent a lot of time looking into. Personally, I can only recommend [VanHack](www.vanhack.com). 

Disclaimer: I never got a job offer through them but did get to a couple of interviews and saw some "classmates" get hired. Unfortunately for me, I did not have the needed experience in the latest automation tools. Also, most of my latest experience has been in QA management which was not a hot candidate for relocation jobs. 

Other job sites to consider, based on my friend's experiences, are [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com), [Indeed](https://indeed.com) and [Glassdoor](https://glassdoor.com).

Pro-Tip: Companies often ask for local (i.e. Canadian) experience. One way to get around this is to look for opportunities to work in cross-cultural teams, whether in multi-national corportaions (MNCs) or even remote work with smaller firms. 

### Personalize Resume



### Common Requirements

Check out the requirements for all your choice countries and start prioritizing them. From our experience, these were the common ones:

- Educational Certification
 - We went with [WES (World Education Services)](https://www.wes.org).
 - I was lucky that my school had an agreement with them which made this really easy for me, so check with your school too. 
- Language Proficiency
 - We went with [IELTS (International English Language Testing System)](https://ieltsregistration.britishcouncil.org).
- Show Money 
	- I already mentioned this above but it is worth mentioning again even though some pathways may not require it 
	- If you have your money stored up in different places, you might want to start slowly consolidating them. Slowly, because you don't want to raise suspicion if you do large money transfers.

## Final Thougths

I wish you all the best in this adventure but, I also want to warn yoou that this is NOT going to be an easy journey. Yes, I'm sure you've heard of the success and fun stories but there are just as many (if not MORE) sad and hard stories. 

We are sharing this not to dishearten you, but to prepare you. 

Good luck!!!

# OLD

This was one of the conversations I had with a former colleague. At first, I wanted to smack him on the head for making me feel ancient. ðŸ˜… It was a valid question though because that was one of the reasons [why we took the student pathway](xxx). 

Not unlike us, he also had a list of countries in mind.

Here's my generic advise, so please take this with a grain of salt, knowing that I don't know your personal situation. Now, most of this will still be focused on Canadian immigration, but there should be parallels to other countries too.

# Look for common requirements




# Look at different pathways

As mentioned, there are different pathways. The student pathway is often the more accessible one, because it has less restrictions on the points, but it can be expensive.

# Look for companies that specialize in relocation jobs and remote jobs

VanHack. Remote.co

Remote jobs get you that experience of working with different cultures. It may NOT be counted in your express entry application, but it can be considered when you apply to job banks.  


Hope that helps. Feel free to reach out if you have more questions. 

## From Alaine
Update resume. Look for jobs through linkedin, indeed and glassdoor. 

Other countries accepting students are UK, Canada, Australia. 

Ipon kasi all these needa money. 

If the person is really serious to go out of Pinas. Start researching, wes, ielts review and test then move from there. Matagal din kasi ang process so check how patient will he/she be habang doing ang mga ito
