Hey Friends! üéôÔ∏è In this episode, I talked to an old friend of mine, Pierre Carlo Conde.

Boyeth gladly shared his nerve-wracking experience as a newbie in Singapore 15 years ago. He talked about the challenges as well as the pros of being an immigrant.

Boyeth also parted some words of wisdom to help future immigrants, not just survive but, thrive in their new environment.
