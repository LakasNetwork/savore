 Serves 6  
 Prep Time   
 Cook Time 20 to 25 minutes  


 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
 2 medium white onions, sliced thinly
 1 large fish boullion
 2 tablespoons red curry paste
 1 28-ounce can coconut milk (gata)
 3 tablespoons brown sugar
 3 to 4 teaspoons fish sauce (patis)
 3 cups water
 250 grams squash, peeled and sliced into
 3/4-inch pieces
 one 28-ounce can straw mushrooms, drained, rinsed (slice into halves, if preferred)
 400 grams tanguigue steak, sliced into 1-inch cubes
 300 grams medium-size shrimps (pang-halabos), peeled
 300 grams squid, cleaned and sliced into 1-inch pieces
 300 grams baby bok choy, washed and torn into halves 

 1. In a large pot over medium heat, sauté onions in vegetable oil until softened. Add the boullion, red curry paste, coconut milk, brown sugar, and patis. Bring the mixture to a boil until you begin to see red splotches of oil pooling on the surface. Add the water and lower the flame to medium-low, keeping the mixture at a consistent simmer.
 2. Add the squash and mushrooms, and let simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.
 3. Add the cubed fish, shrimps, and squid; simmer for an additional 4 to 5 minutes or until seafood are cooked through.
 4. Turn off the heat and place the baby bok choy on top of the stew, pressing the vegetables down with a spoon. Cover the pot with a lid; it will take 3 to 4 minutes for the bok choy to wilt. Stir through the mixture once, taste; add fish sauce to taste.
 5. Serve with hot steamed rice.
