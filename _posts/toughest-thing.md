## Intro

First of all, I feel that I need to qualify the title with "So Far." We've only been (technically) out of the country for about a year so I'm sure tougher times will come. 

Let's get to it!

## FOMO

FOMO, or the Fear Of Missing Out, is real.

Especially in this connected world!

When I left my second home of Jakarta, to head back to Manila, I had this feeling too. I left my circle of friends and felt bad about missing all the good times they were having without me. And that was in reading letters (yes, snail mail) every month or so!

Nowadays, you get bombarded with reminders of things that you are missing out. From your friend's social media posts and, worst, that group chat. Sometimes, I just want to leave those altogether but I ... that FOMO might get even worst. 

## Being Forgotten
E.g. Bonj

## Not Being Present
E.g. Jopet's Dad, Lolo's Passing
