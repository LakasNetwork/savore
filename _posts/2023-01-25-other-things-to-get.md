Man, time flies by so fast when you're having fun! 

Yup, that's going to be our excuse for our three month radio silence. I mean, so much happened in that time but, I ain't lying... we were having fun amidst the chaos and uncertainty of this move to Canada. Sure, we've been here for over a year already, but there are still so many things that surprise us that make this so much fun.

Anyway, back to the topic that we left off from.

What are other things you might want to get once you land?

*Uhm, if you haven't landed, I will be talking some more about that soon. Watch out for it ;) *

## Driver's License

Even if you don't plan on getting a car or driving yet, you might want to get your Toronto driving experience started. Toronto, specifically, has a tiered license system and it is good if you start that as soon as you can.

Note: This was a mistake I made. I waited 9 months before getting starting the process.

1. This means you start earning time and this is credited to you once you get your actual driving license.
2. The license acts as your valid identification card, so you don't have to keep bringing important documents with you such as your passport and proof of residence
3. Since it is a tiered system, you can actually get a G1 license even if you have no practical driving experience, since it is basically a learner's permit where you just need to take a written (or computer-based) test. I will share the notes I used to study for this soon.

For those coming from the Philippines (although this is probably applicable with other countries as well), get a LTO and DFA certification if you've already beend driving for years. This is the only way your actual driving experience will be recognized in Toronto. Why does years of experience matter? Lower Insurance! Nuff' said. 

## Ontario Card

Now, if you really have no intention of driving anytime soon, an Ontario card is your next bet for getting a valid identification card right away. 

It's a pretty quick process. You simply need to book an appointment (or even walk-in, if you're feeling lucky) with Service Ontario, pay the processing fee ($40 during our time) and wait for a couple of weeks.

Note: There are other equivalent cards, depending on the province you land in.

## Toronto Public Library

Here's another card you might want to get especially if you need a quiet place to work from, or look for work from. You will probably have pretty decent internet where you are staying at but, if you're like us who had to share a place first, you probably want a quiet space to work from, or to look for work from.

What's nice about the public libraries here is that they have private rooms you can book, where you can take remote interviews from. 

While you're there, you can also attend their educational programs during your break. They usually have interesting lessons about a variety of topics going on. 

## Presto

Lastly is the Presto card to help you get around the city. 

*PRESTO is an electronic payment system that eliminates the need for tickets, tokens, passes and cash. PRESTO works across local transit in the Greater Toronto, Hamilton and Ottawa areas, which makes paying for your trip simple, convenient and secure.*

Again, this is optional, since you can always pay by cash but it is a lot more convenient. 

1. You don't have to carry a bunch of coins (although I still keep a bare minimum with me in case my card malfunctions -- that's me being risk-averse)
2. You don't have to get a receipt when you ride, to show to the next bus in your route. One tap gets you a free pass for two hours. This is done automatically with the card.
3. You can set it up to be automatically loaded, so you don't have to worry about reloading
