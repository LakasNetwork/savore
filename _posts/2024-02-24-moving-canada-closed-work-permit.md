In this episode of The Immigrant Chronicles, I catch-up with my former officemate, Abigail Arceo. 

Abby shares her eventful journey from the Philippines to Canada at the height of the pandemic, from applying for jobs to getting the visa and going through all the hoops and loops to finally make it here. She also gives out helpful tips to those planning to take the leap.
